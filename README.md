# Predicting-Film-Popularity
Utilized machine learning methodologies to predict the popularity of films by analyzing multiple attributes, such as cast, genre, budget, and release timing.
This project is useful for film producers and marketing teams to inform strategic decision-making.

Key Features:

Algorithms: Regression Models, SVM (Support Vector Machine), Decision Tree.

Preprocessing Techniques: Data cleaning, normalization, and handling missing values to ensure high-quality input data.

Feature Selection: Applied techniques such as correlation analysis, mutual information, and recursive feature elimination to identify the most significant predictors of film popularity.
